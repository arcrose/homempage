Right before we submitted the 10th flag, we were right behind the VulnHub team,
who we'd been competing toe-to-toe with for the duration of the event. With
just a few seconds remaining we had managed to submit the 10th flag and pull into the lead.
This whole event was a lot of fun and incredibly exciting. My two excellent teammates,
Anna and Dave, stuck with me for the entire eight hours, and there's no way we would
have have done anywhere near as well as we did without their help.  I had no expectations
of doing as well as we did, given that this was my first time participating, but it was
a great deal of fun and I'm looking forward to doing more in the future.
The Defcon Toronto group is a pretty young one, having only been around for about four
months, but it's already one of my favorites in the city. I want to say thanks to the
entire DC416 crew for putting these challenges together and to everyone that
participated for the great competition!
