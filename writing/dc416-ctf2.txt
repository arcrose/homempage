This weekend, on September 10, 2016, the Defcon Toronto Meetup group hosted their
first ever CTF!  I was able to put together a team including myself, my friend
David, and Anna, someone who happened to be broadcasting their interest in the CTF
via the group's Slack channel (and doesn't have Twitter). David himself is actually
heavily involved in Carleton University's CTF team, however neither I nor Anna
have participated in a CTF before, though both of us have done some web appsec challenges.
The whole event took place over the course of eight hours which my team spent
frantically searching for clues and finding flags.  It is obvious in our unorthodox
approaches to things that neither Anna nor I had partaken in a CTF before, but
fortunately David had some familiarity with enough tools to get us through some
trickier challenges.

Despite all of our fumbling, my team actually managed to come out in first place!
We had a great time and were competing down to the wire to come out ahead.
I'll post a link to David's writeup when he gets to it, as well as Anna's if
she writes one, but for now I'll write about the challenges I can recall in detail.
